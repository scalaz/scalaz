Scalaz is a library written in the Scala Programming Language. One mandate of the library is to depend
only on the core Scala API and the core Java 2 Standard Edition API. The intention of Scalaz is to include general
functions that are not currently available in the core Scala API. Scalaz is released under a BSD open source licence
making it compatible with the licence of the Scala project.

The source code for Scalaz is hosted on GitHub: http://github.com/scalaz/scalaz

Documentation and downloads are on Google Code: http://code.google.com/p/scalaz/

Snapshots and Releases published to the repository on [scala-tools.org](http://scala-tools.org/).
