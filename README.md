Scalaz is a Scala library for functional programming.

It provides purely functional data structures to complement those from the Scala standard library. It defines a set of foundational type classes (e.g. `Functor`, `Monad`) and corresponding instances for a large number of data structures.

## Documentation

Scalaz provides a website with examples and documentation for a large subset of its capabilities.
It can be found [here](https://nequissimus.com/scalaz/).
