/* 
 * `Task[A]` is a `scalaz.concurrent.Future[Either[Throwable,A]]`, 
 * with some convenience functions for handling exceptions. Its 
 * `Monad` and `Nondeterminism` instances are derived from `Future`.
 * 
 * `Task` (and `Future`) differ in several key ways from 
 * `scalaz.concurrent.Promise` and the `Future` implementation in 
 * Scala 2.10 , and have a number of advantages. See the documentation
 * for `scalaz.concurrent.Future` for more information. 
 * 
 * `Task` is exception-safe when constructed using the primitives
 * in the companion object, but when calling the constructor, you
 * are responsible for ensuring the exception safety of the provided
 * `Future`.
