/** 
 * `Future` is a trampolined computation producing an `A` that may 
 * include asynchronous steps. Like `Trampoline`, arbitrary 
 * monadic expressions involving `map` and `flatMap` are guaranteed
 * to use constant stack space. But in addition, one may construct a
 * `Future` from an asynchronous computation, represented as a
 * function, `listen: (A => Unit) => Unit`, which registers a callback
 * that will be invoked when the result becomes available. This makes 
 * `Future` useful as a concurrency primitive and as a control 
 * structure for wrapping callback-based APIs with a more 
 * straightforward, monadic API.
 * 
 * Unlike the `Future` implementation in scala 2.10, `map` and 
 * `flatMap` do NOT spawn new tasks and do not require an implicit
 * `ExecutionContext`. Instead, `map` and `flatMap` merely add to 
 * the current (trampolined) continuation that will be run by the 
 * 'current' thread, unless explicitly forked via `Future.fork` or 
 * `Future.apply`. This means that `Future` achieves much better thread
 * reuse than the 2.10 implementation and avoids needless thread
 * pool submit cycles. 
 *  
 * `Future` also differs from the scala 2.10 `Future` type in that it 
 * does not necessarily represent a _running_ computation. Instead, we
 * reintroduce nondeterminism _explicitly_ using the functions of the
 * `scalaz.Nondeterminsm` interface. This simplifies our implementation 
 * and makes code easier to reason about, since the order of effects 
 * and the points of nondeterminism are made fully explicit and do not
 * depend on Scala's evaluation order. 
 * 
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: `Future` does not include any error handling and
 * should generally only be used as a building block by library 
 * writers who want to build on `Future`'s capabilities but wish to 
 * design their own error handling strategy. See 
 * `scalaz.concurrent.Task` for a type that extends `Future` with 
 * proper error handling -- it is merely a wrapper for 
 * `Future[Throwable \/ A]` with a number of additional
 * convenience functions.
