Build Instructions (Using SBT)
------------------------------

The root directory of the project contains the SBT launcher, shell script, and Windows command script.

This is the directory structure of the build.

|- project +
|          |-build +
|          |       |- ScalazProject.scala.   Project Definition, containing module structure, compiler
|          |       |                         options, cross module dependencies, etc.
|          |       |- build.properties       Version of SBT, Scala, and Scalaz.
|          |                                 A different version of Scala is used to run SBT and compile
|          |                                 the Project Definition than is used to compile Scalaz.
|          |-target                          Compiled Project Definition
|          |
|-         +-boot                            Versions of Scala Compiler and Library.

|- <mod N> +

           |-src   +
           |       |-main +
           |       |      |-scala            Source files
           |       |
           |       |-test +
           |              |-scala            Test source files
           |
           |-lib_managed                     Managed Dependencies for this module, e.g. Scalacheck.
           |
           |-target +
                    | - <scala version M>    All built artifacts (classes, jars, scaladoc) for module N
                                             built for version M of Scala.

0. alias sbt=sh $PWD/sbt.sh (on Unix systems)
1. sbt update (this step is required after a fresh checkout, after changing the version of 
                     SBT, Scala, or other dependencies)
2. sbt [compile | package | test-compile | test | publish-local | publish]

For continuous compilation of a module:

1. sbt
2. > project scalaz-core
3. > ~compile
