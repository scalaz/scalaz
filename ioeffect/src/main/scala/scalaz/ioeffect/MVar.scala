/**
 * `MVar` is a primitive useful for communicating between fibers, and they can
 * be used to build locks, queues, and other concurrent primitives.
 *
 * Technically, an `MVar` is a variable that can be empty or full, and can be
 * thought of as a two-sided blocking queue of capacity 1, which blocks on takes
 * when there is nothing to take, and blocks on puts when there is already
 * something there.
 *
 * `MVar` values are asynchronous and do not actually block.
 *
 * {{{
 * for {
 *   v <- IO.emptyMVar[Int] // A new empty `MVar` that holds `Int`
 *   _ <- v.put(3).fork     // In a separate fiber, put 3 into the `MVar`
 *   i <- v.take            // Resumes when the above `put` succeeds
 *   _ <- putStrLn("Value = " + i.toString) // "Value = 3"
 * } yield i
