# Type classes

_A type class is a type system construct that supports ad hoc polymorphism.
This is achieved by adding constraints to type variables in parametrically polymorphic types._ <sup>[1](#f1)</sup>

Type class instances allow us to add behaviour to types without changing the types themselves.
