/**
 * The data type `Is` is the encoding of Leibnitz’ law which states that
 * if `a` and `b` are identical then they must have identical properties.
 * Leibnitz’ original definition reads as follows:
 *   a ≡ b = ∀ f .f a ⇔ f b
 * and can be proven to be equivalent to:
 *   a ≡ b = ∀ f .f a → f b
 *
 * The `Is` data type encodes true type equality, since the identity
 * function is the only non-diverging conversion function that can be used
 * as an implementation of the `subst` method assuming that we do not break
 * parametricity. As the substitution function has to work for any `F[_]`, it
 * cannot make assumptions about the structure of `F[_]`, making it impossible
 * to construct a value of type `F[A]` or to access values of type `A` that
 * may be stored inside a value of type `F[A]`. Hence it is impossible for
 * a substitution function to alter the value it takes as argument.
 *
 * Not taking into account the partial functions that never terminate
 * (infinite loops), functions returning `null`, or throwing exceptions,
 * the identity function is the only function that can be used in place of
 * `subst` to construct a value of type `Is[A, B]`.
 *
 * The existence of a value of type `Is[A, B]` now implies that a ≡ b,
 * since the conversion function, that converts an `A` into a `B`, must be
 * the identity function.
 *
 * This technique was first used in
 * [[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=583852.581494
 * Typing Dynamic Typing]] (Baars and Swierstra, ICFP 2002).
 *
 * @see [[===]] `A === B` is a type synonym to `Is[A, B]`
 * @see [[http://typelevel.org/blog/2014/09/20/higher_leibniz.html
