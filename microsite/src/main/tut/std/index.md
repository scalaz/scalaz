# Standard Library Support

Scalaz includes typeclass instances for the primitive data types in the base library.

The following types are considered primitives:

- Boolean
- Byte
- Double
- Float
- Int
- Long
- Short
- String
- Unit

For additional support of standard library classes, an additional module `scalaz-std` is available.
Support for `List`, `Set`, `Option` and more have been added. For more information, consult the subpages to this document.
