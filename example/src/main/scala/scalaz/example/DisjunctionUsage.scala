     Example #1: Infix Notation
         Infix notation is commonly used and is easier to read.
         For our first example using disjunctions, this
         is generally an easier notation to follow. The default
         notation to use, Standard Notation, is not as clear
         but will be covered following this example.

    * The goal is to handle failures elegantly and keep

    * and terminating.
