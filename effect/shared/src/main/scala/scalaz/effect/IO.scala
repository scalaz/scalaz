/**
 * An `IO[A]` ("Eye-Oh of A") is an immutable data structure that describes an
 * effectful action that may throw an exception (`Throwable`), run forever, or
 * produce a single `A` at some point in the future.
 *
 * `IO` values are ordinary immutable values, and may be used like any other
 * values in purely functional code. Because `IO` values just *describe*
 * effects, which must be interpreted by a separate runtime system, they are
 * entirely pure and do not violate referential transparency.
 *
 * `IO` values can efficiently describe the following classes of effects:
 *
 *  * **Pure Values** &mdash; `IO.apply`
 *  * **Synchronous Effects** &mdash; `IO.sync`
 *  * **Asynchronous Effects** &mdash; `IO.async`
 *  * **Concurrent Effects** &mdash; `io.fork`
 *  * **Resource Effects** &mdash; `io.bracket`
 *
 * The concurrency model is based on *fibers*, a user-land lightweight thread,
 * which permit cooperative multitasking, fine-grained interruption, and very
 * high performance with large numbers of concurrently executing fibers.
 *
 * `IO` values compose with other `IO` values in a variety of ways to build
 * complex, rich, interactive applications. See the methods on `IO` for more
 * details about how to compose `IO` values.
 *
 * In order to integrate with Scala, `IO` values must be interpreted into the
 * Scala runtime. This process of interpretation executes the effects described
 * by a given immutable `IO` value. For more information on interpreting `IO`
 * values, see the default interpreter in `RTS` or the safe main function in
 * `SafeApp`.
