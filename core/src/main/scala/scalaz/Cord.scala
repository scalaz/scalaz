/**
 * A `Cord` is a purely functional data structure for efficiently creating a
 * `String` from smaller parts, useful for printing ADTs that must write out
 * their contents into a text format.
 *
 * A `z` interpolator is available for building `String` from literals, using
 * the `Show` typeclass to populate each "hole", and a `cord` interpolator
 * for building `Cord` instances.
 *
 * If a more efficient solution is required to write a large `String` to a
 * network socket or file, consider https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/issues/1797
 *
 * If you require a general text manipulation data structure, consider using
 * `FingerTree` or creating a custom structure to resemble that used by the
 * popular text editors:
